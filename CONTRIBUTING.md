# Contributing

Contributions are encouraged, and they are greatly appreciated! Every little bit helps, and credit will always be given.

## Get Started

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up `inorbit-connector-python` for local development.

1. Fork the `inorbit-connector-python` repo on [GitHub](https://github.com/inorbit-ai/inorbit-connector-python).

2. Clone your fork locally:

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:{your_username_here}/inorbit-connector-python.git
   ```

3. Install the project in editable mode. (It is also recommended to work in a `virtualenv` environment):

   ```bash
   cd inorbit-connector-python
   virtualenv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -e .[dev]
   ```

   If you prefer to use [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv):

   ```bash
   uv venv --python 3.13
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   uv pip install -e .[dev]
   ```

4. Create a branch for local development:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b {your_development_type}/short-description
   ```

   Ex: feature/read-tiff-files or bugfix/handle-file-not-found<br>
   Now you can make your changes locally.

5. When you're done making changes, check that your changes pass linting and tests, including testing other Python
   versions with tox:

   ```bash
   tox
   ```

6. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Resolves #xyz. Your detailed description of your changes."
   git push origin {your_development_type}/short-description
   ```

7. Submit a pull request through the [GitHub](https://github.com/inorbit-ai/inorbit-connector-python/pulls) website.

## Documentation

The documentation lives in the `docs/` directory and is built with Sphinx using Markdown.

### Install documentation dependencies

Use the project extras:

```bash
python -m pip install .[docs]
# or with uv
uv pip install .[docs]
```

### Build the site

Using the Makefile generated by Sphinx:

```bash
make -C docs/sphinx html
```

Or directly with sphinx-build:

```bash
sphinx-build -b html docs/sphinx docs/sphinx/_build/html
```

Open the result in your browser:

```bash
# Linux
xdg-open docs/sphinx/_build/html/index.html
```

Clean build artifacts:

```bash
make -C docs/sphinx clean
```

### Publishing (CI)

The workflow at `.github/workflows/docs.yaml` builds the docs and deploys them via GitHub Pages. The documentation is automatically deployed when a new release is published. The deployment URL is shown in the workflow output (`page_url`).

#### Manual Deployment

To manually deploy the documentation, you can trigger the workflow using the GitHub Actions UI:

1. Navigate to the [Actions](https://github.com/inorbit-ai/inorbit-connector-python/actions) tab in the repository
2. Select the "Publish documentation" workflow from the left sidebar
3. Click the "Run workflow" button (located at the top right of the workflow runs list)
4. Select the branch you want to deploy from (typically `main`)
5. Click the green "Run workflow" button to start the deployment

The workflow will build and deploy the documentation to GitHub Pages, and the deployment URL will be available in the workflow run output.

## Reuse compliance check

To check if the project is compliant with the REUSE compliance, run the following command:

```bash
reuse --root . lint
```

To fix the issues, run the following command:

```bash
reuse annotate --copyright "InOrbit, Inc." --license "MIT" --recursive . --skip-unrecognised
```

## Version bump and release - Maintainers only

To release a new version:

1. Ensure you're on the latest `main` branch:

   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull
   ```

2. Bump the version using `bump2version`. This automatically increments the version number in the
   places specified in the `.bumpversion.cfg` file:

   ```bash
   # Use major, minor, or patch to increment the version number
   bump2version patch --dry-run --verbose
   bump2version patch
   ```

3. Push both the commit and the tag:

   ```bash
   git push
   git push --tags
   ```

CI automatically publishes to PyPI when either:

- A tag is pushed, or
- A commit message contains "Bump version"

After publishing to PyPI, CI also signs the artifacts and creates/updates the GitHub Release.
